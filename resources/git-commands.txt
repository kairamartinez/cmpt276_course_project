Assuming everyone is using VS studio, the process is simple, 
just clone the repo to a folder to start the workspace.

After that, all git commands are availble in the "source control" tab on the left side;
If you do not see it, the tab is prob just hidden, 
right click the left bar, and click on "version control" to lock it, or alternatively "Ctrl+Shift+G" will also pop it up.

In Bobby's video he demomstrated the process alr, so this is more just a summary
Once you finish working on it and want to push(assuming you already have a remote repo):

git add . (stage the whole folder to add to remote repo)

git commit -m "(commit message here)" (commit staged changes)

git push (remote name: usually origin) (branch name: usually main/ github defaults to master but both is common)
ps. we are probably gonna use: $ it push origin main

pps. if this is your first push you will need your github username, password, and the ssh key

ppps. reminder, command line git is only if your source control doesn't work, is linked wrong or smth.
      otherwise the best thing to do is to use source control.

to set up source control, rly simple, just clone desired repo into a folder, 
and add that repo's link to your remote repo

update all branches from iteration 2 now deleted (still avaible in github history)
for iteration 3, open new branches out of main to merge back.
